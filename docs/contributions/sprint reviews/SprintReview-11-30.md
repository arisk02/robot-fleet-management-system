## What we did well:
For this sprint review, I think we worked even more cohesively and had no issues with delegating out tasks and communicating with each other. We've also been doing better about understanding each others roles as much as possible while also trusting each other to figure out the fine details.

## What we could improve:
We could still work to plan out our tasks further in advance so that we each have our specific tasks lined up. There were a few tasks that also went unassigned for a while and we could do better to iron out assignments sooner.
