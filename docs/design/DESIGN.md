# Robotic Cleaning System Design Hub
Here you will find an overview of the documentation created during and for the development of Team BECA's Robotic Cleaning Software.



## Use Case Diagrams
We developed two use case diagrams which both live in one file that provides information about each as well as information regarding the developer contributions to that portion of the project. The two diagrams separate the uses for the Robot Manager and the Robot itself, which are the two actors involved in our software. [The use case diagrams can be found here.](usecases.md)
